A 5x5 cm combo breakout board with different breakouts on front and backsides.

* __Front:__ 
 * 4 x SOIC-16  
 * 4 x SOIC-8 
 * 4 x SOT23-6
* __Back:__ 
 * 4 x TSSOP-16 
 * 4 x TSSOP-8 
 * 4 x SOT-23 (dual)

###NU-ThruXtal
![NU-ThruXtal](https://raw.github.com/SmallRoomLabs/NanoUtils/master/NU-ThruXtal/Doc/NU-ThruXtal-Front-400.jpg)

A small breakout-style board with a crystal, caps and a resistor on it. This board is suitable for easy add a crystal to an Atmel ATmega or many Microchip PIC-series microcontrollers like the PIC18F2550 having a GND pin next to the two XTAL pins.
This is a variant of the NU-Xtal board supporting HC-49 crystals in both SMD and thru hole. The load caps can be fitted with either SMD or thru hole caps in two sizes.

###NU-Oledy
![NU-Oledy](https://raw.github.com/SmallRoomLabs/NanoUtils/master/NU-Oledy/Doc/oledy-gerber-250.png)

Breakout boards for experimenting with OLED displays. The board have 32 pads in 0.5, 0.6, 0.62, 0.65, 0.7, 0.8, 0.845 and 1.0 mm pitches.
