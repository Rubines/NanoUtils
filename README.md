NanoUtils
=========

The NanoUtils are a series of small unility / breakout PCBs created by Mats Engstrom @ SmallRoomLabs

The following PCBs are currently a part of NanoUtils:

***

###NU-Xtal

A small breakout-style board with a crystal, caps and a resistor on it. This board is suitable for easy add a crystal to an Atmel ATmega or many Microchip PIC-series microcontrollers like the PIC18F2550 having a GND pin next to the two XTAL pins.

###NU-Sockisop

A 5x5 cm combo breakout board with different breakouts on front and backsides.

* __Front:__ 
 * 4 x SOIC-16  
 * 4 x SOIC-8 
 * 4 x SOT23-6
* __Back:__ 
 * 4 x TSSOP-16 
 * 4 x TSSOP-8 
 * 4 x SOT-23 (dual)

###NU-Fithole

A small keyfob-like tool for checking the dimension of component leads.

###NU-ThruXtal
![NU-ThruXtal](https://raw.github.com/SmallRoomLabs/NanoUtils/master/NU-ThruXtal/Doc/NU-ThruXtal-Front-400.jpg)

A small breakout-style board with a crystal, caps and a resistor on it. This board is suitable for easy add a crystal to an Atmel ATmega or many Microchip PIC-series microcontrollers like the PIC18F2550 having a GND pin next to the two XTAL pins.
This is a variant of the NU-Xtal board supporting HC-49 crystals in both SMD and thru hole. The load caps can be fitted with either SMD or thru hole caps in two sizes.
